# Gesture Volume Control
This project implements a gesture-controlled volume adjustment system using a webcam and MediaPipe for hand tracking. Users can control the system volume by rotating their index finger in a circular motion. The application displays the webcam feed and provides real-time volume status updates.

* opencv-python: Handles image processing and video display.
* mediapipe: Detects hand landmarks and recognizes gestures.
* numpy: Performs numerical computations and data analysis.
* pycaw: Controls system audio on Windows.
* comtypes: Facilitates COM interactions on Windows, used by pycaw.
